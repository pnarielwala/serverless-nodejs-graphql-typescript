# Serverless NodeJS Typescript GraphQL

## Goal

What I wanted to acheive was to essentially to learn how to create a full stack application.
I was already pretty verse in creating a frontend/client-side application with React and
Vanilla JS, but I figured that was a little useless if I didn't have a persistent layer
to support it. I've heard the term "serverless" for some time now and with the quarantine
in effect, I felt like this is the perfect time to play around with this.

Once I have a backend server up and running, I can create a frontend or native app using this
data.

## Graphql

Graphql is getting super popular (if not already) and I've just started working on it at
work. So if I was going to setup a backend service, why not use the latest technology
and tools?

## Serverless

As a frontend engineer, I don't have much experience with backend services, let alone how to set one up, but a coworker told me about [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) and how it makes it easy to setup a backend service with AWS.

## Get offline playground working

This took a lot of tinkering, then a night of sleep, then more tinkering.
